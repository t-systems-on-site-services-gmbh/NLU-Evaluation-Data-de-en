# NLU Evaluation Data de-en

This project contains natural languageg data for human-robot interaction
in home domain which we collected and annotated for evaluating NLU Services/platforms.

This dataset builds on the annotated data of the [xliuhw/NLU-Evaluation-Data](https://github.com/xliuhw/NLU-Evaluation-Data) repository. We have added an additional column (`answer_de`)
by translating the texts in column `answer` into German.
